QUES:
It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.
Input
The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


SOLUTION:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n,k,l,m,o,r,p;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    p=n+1;

    while(n>=1000&&n<=9000)
    { r=p;
        k=r%10;
        r=r/10;
        l=r%10;
        r=r/10;
        m=r%10;
        r=r/10;
        o=r;
        if(k!=l&&k!=m&&k!=o&&l!=m&&l!=o&&m!=o)
        {
            printf("%d%d%d%d",o,m,l,k);
            break;
        }
          else
          {
              p++;

          }
    }



    return 0;
}
