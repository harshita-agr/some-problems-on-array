QUES:
You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.

Input
The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive ( > 0) and do not exceed 104. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.

Output
Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.

SOLUTION:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{ long a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h;

scanf("%d%d%d",&d,&e,&f);
g=(d*f)/e;
a=sqrt(g);
b=d/a;
c=f/a;
h=4*a+4*b+4*c;

    printf("%d",h);
    return 0;
}
