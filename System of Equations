QUES:
Furik loves math lessons very much, so he doesn't attend them, unlike Rubik. But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?

You are given a system of equations:


You should count, how many there are pairs of integers (a, b) (0 ≤ a, b) which satisfy the system.

Input
A single line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the parameters of the system. The numbers on the line are separated by a space.

Output
On a single line print the answer to the problem.

SOLUTION:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n,m,i,j,t,k,count=0;

    scanf("%d",&n);
    scanf("%d",&m);

    for(i=0; i<=32; i++)
    {
        for(j=0; j<=32; j++)
        {
            t=i*i+j;
            k=i+j*j;
            if(t==n && k==m)
               {

                count++;
                }

        }

    }
    printf("%d",count);
    return 0;
}
